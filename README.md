# 🌤️ WeatherApp – Task 5 (Internship @ Prodigy Infotech)

This is **Task 5** of my internship at **Prodigy Infotech**, where I created a simple and clean **Weather App** using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The app allows users to enter any city name and fetches real-time weather data from the **OpenWeatherMap API**.
